Create a page that lists out a bunch of movie data for the viewer to enjoy.

Review the wireframe, and data in the main.js file.

1. Create a function called printMovie() in main.js
2. Create a variable, then assign it to a new array created by using the 'map' method on the movieData.  The map should return a template string with the relevant HTML.
3. Use the 'join' method to turn the variable into one string and set it as the innerHTML of the 'mainContent' div.
